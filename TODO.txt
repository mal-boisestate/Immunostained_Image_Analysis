1. Add mode recognition (theshold and unet)
2. For defferent resolution create different tresholds for nucleus area
3. Read resolution at the begginning and based on resolution use specifid settings.
    Maybe create object of resolution settings.
3. Create different flow of analysis for imagies with different resolution
4. In ImageData (img_8bit = (channel.img / 256).astype('uint8')) create different way to convers image
  to 8 bit. Since depth can be different.
5. Do we need normalization for 8bit visualisation? For example, mChary if dim,
if not normalised it is not possible to see any signal.
6. Make edges smooth by applying increase and decrease of conters
7. Save only dapi channel
